However, the camera poses that are provided allows to move from camera to world coordinate, and are given as $3 \\times 4$ matrices of the form $[ R_i | T_i ]$. Thus a function that would allow to obtain the relative pose between the two cameras is convenient. Such a relative pose would also be a $3 \\times 4$ matrix of the form $[ R | T]$, and transforms indeed from camera 1 to camera 2 coordinate.\n",
